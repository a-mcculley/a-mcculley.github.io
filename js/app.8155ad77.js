During my undergraduate study, I took a wide variety of courses in a large number of different subfields. AI, Programming Language theory, UI Development, Software Engineering, Computational Linguistics, and even Quantum Information Science, to name just a few of the subjects I dabbled in. While this has meant that I am not a master of any specific field, it does mean that I am a jack of all trades and can be competently placed in a wide variety of positions. This experience, jumping between so many different areas, has also made me able to very quickly learn. I have learned how to learn quickly and adapt as necessary to new expectations. Additionally, this wide variety of courses has led me to learn a large variety of languages and become proficient in a wide variety of tools, a list of which you can find on my resume or in the "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"#section-skills"}},[e._v("Skills ")]),e._v("section of this page.")]),t("p",[e._v("Secondly, I have also built strong fundamentals in computer science. My role as an Instructional Aide for EECS 281 helped me build extremely strong fundamentals, as that course is considered the keystone course of the University of Michigan's computer science department, with success in the course allowing students to take upper level courses. Teaching this foundational course for 6 semesters ingrained strong fundamentals. Another example of how I've built such strong fundamentals is simply how long I have been coding, with my first computer science experience being in the Fall of 2015. Finally, my experience as a private tutor is another thing that has deepened my skill at the fundamentals, as I have taught students with a wide variety of computer science backgrounds at a number of different course levels, which has further strengthened my skills in the fundamentals.")]),t("p",[e._v("Finally, I have developed exceptional communication skills, both written and oral. I have used a wide variety of strategies in order to do so. Firstly, I would like to highlight my Political Science minor, which is unique for a Computer Science major. Over the course of completing my coursework, I wrote many essays on a wide variety of topics and positions (also developing substantial research skills), which led to the development of a high degree of skill in rhetoric. Additionally, during my coursework, I had to do a large number of presentations, which developed my public speaking skills, though my other experiences showcase my abilities in that regard more, with my experience as an Instructional Aide as the most important example. As previously discussed, EECS 281 is a foundational course, and it is one that students often find difficult, so teaching it for so long with such efficacy has taught me a wide range of public speaking skills and strategies in order to best reach as many students as possible. As opposed to the rhetorical focus of my Political Science minor, my experience as an Instructional Aide was instead focused on technical communication. Additionally, in my experience teaching as an Instructional Aide, I had to learn how to communicate effectively with people from a number of different backgrounds, something that I take particular pride in. A final example of my skill in communication is my experience as a private tutor, which is very similar to my experiences as an Instructional Aide. One aspect that I want to highlight about my tutoring experience that is more prominent than it was as an Instructional Aide is that tutoring has improved my skills at communicating with people at different levels of ability, even when talking about highly complicated subjects. Another thing I want to lightly touch on is my leadership skills, which I view as a subset of my broader communication skills. Over the course of my experience Instructional Aide, I took a leadership role multiple times; I led grading teams several times, once even asked on the day of the exam to do so and also mentored new staff every semester - aside from my first of course.")])])},function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;return t("div",{staticClass:"section container"},[t("a",{staticClass:"anchor",attrs:{id:"section-edu"}}),t("h2",[t("i",{staticClass:"bi-mortarboard"}),e._v(" Education")]),t("div",{staticClass:"container d-flex flex-row flex-wrap p-3"},[t("div",{staticClass:"card m-0 edu-card"},[t("div",{staticClass:"card-body"},[t("h4",{staticClass:"card-title"},[e._v("University of Michigan - Ann Arbor")]),t("h5",{staticClass:"card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"},[t("b",[e._v("B.S.E. in Computer Science")]),e._v("; College of Engineering")]),t("h6",{staticClass:"card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"},[e._v("Minor in Political Science")]),t("hr"),t("p",[e._v("In Computer Science, I went for a breadth of topics instead of focusing on particular subfields.

In EECS 370, you will see how a low-level language is executed by the hardware, and you will see how to put together basic, hardware building blocks to form the functional units of a computer. To achieve these goals, you will design and "build" simple computers at various levels of detail. In this course, building will not mean connecting chips and gates. Rather, you will describe the hardware in diagrams, finite-state machines, and hardware simulators (written in C).

It was long believed that information processing and computing were solely mathematical constructs and as such were independent of nature and the laws of quantum mechanics. In the 1980\'s this assumption was found to be untrue, and the consequences have been profound. The introduction of quantum mechanics into communications and computation has produced new paradigms (quantum information and computation) and some unforeseen results in the fields of computation, communications and learning. For example, quantum algorithms have now been found for factoring composite numbers (Shor\'s algorithms 1994). In contrast, there are no known practical (i.e., polynomial time) classical solutions for the problem. This course is an introduction to this general area. No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics, classical computing or information is assumed.\n                        <br>\n                        <span class="bold">Languages and Tools:</span> Python, QISKIT',eecs492:'<span class="bold">Course Guide Description:</span> Introduction to the core concepts of AI, organized around building computational agents.

Though there is widespread agreement about the magnitude of this change, there is intense debate about how to characterize the crisis it poses.

As the U.S. successfully emerged from WWII and eased into “the nifty ‘50\'s”, consensus opinion held that Americans were enjoying a version of the best life. As incomes rose, some even posited an age of political consensus and “the end of ideology.” However, challenges loomed, and ideological contestation and dissent didn\'t die after all. Contestation in the post-war era touched on some key categories in political theory: justice, equality, freedom, citizenship, and public voice. Some of the specific issues this class will consider: consumer culture, rural and urban poverty, environmentalism, public health, civil rights, race hierarchy, women\'s rights, youth culture, the new left, gay rights (as it was then called), neo-conservatism, immigration, the red scare, atomic build-up, the cold war, state secrecy, and the military draft.\n                        <br>\n                        <span class="bold">Syllabus Description:</span> Political theory is form of analysis. It explores and evaluates the ideas and concepts that shape public life. Political theorists think clearly about political circumstances as they exist and as they might exist. Political theory can also be thought of as a tool to help you better understand the world and a tool that empowers you to act in the world. The class is on American political theory in the post-war era, roughly 1945-1980.\n                        <br>\n                        <span class="bold">Noteworthy Readings:</span>\n                        <ul>\n                        <li>Roosevelt, Four Freedoms Address</li>\n                        <li>Dewey, Creative Democracy</li>\n                        <li>Galbraith, The Affluent Society</li>\n                        <li>Harrington, The Other America</li>\n                        <li>Carson, Silent Spring</li>\n                        <li>Riesman, The Lonely Crowd</li>\n                        <li>Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom</li>\n                        <li>Rothstein, The Color of Law</li>\n                        <li>Satter, Family Properties: Race, Real Estate, and the Exploitation of Black Urban America</li>\n                        <li>Schor, Born to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture</li>\n                        <li>Cheever, The Swimmer</li>\n                        <li>King, The Drum Major Instinct</li>\n                        <li>Black Panther Party Platform</li>\n                        <li>King, I\'ve Been to the Mountaintop</li>\n                        <li>Baker, Bigger Than A Hamburger</li>\n                        <li>Branch, The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement</li>\n                        <li>Olstad, Cigarette Advertising</li>\n                        <li>Blum, Blowing Smoke: The Lost Legacy of the 1964 Surgeon General\'s Report on Smoking and Health</li>\n                        <li>Mills, The Power Elite</li>\n                        <li>Hofstadter, The Paranoid Style in American Politics</li>\n                        <li>Alinsky, Rules for Radicals</li>\n                        <li>Friedan, The Feminine Mystique</li>\n                        <li>Coontz, A Strange Stirring</li>\n                        <li>Combahee River Collective Statement</li>\n                        <li>SNCC, Women in the Movement</li>\n                        <li>Moynahan, The Negro Family: A case for national action</li>\n                        <li>Faderman, Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers</li>\n                        <li>Rich, Diving into the Wreck</li>\n                        <li>Lorde, Coal</li>\n                        <li>Lorde, A Woman Speaks</li>\n                        <li>Issacson, The Innovators</li>\n                        <li>Hayden, Port Huron Statement</li>\n                        <li>Eisenhower, Farewell Address</li>\n                        <li>Hersh, The My Lai Massacre</li>\n                        <li>Arendt, Lying in Politics: Reflections on the Pentagon Papers</li>\n                        <li>Buckley, Up from Liberalism</li>\n                        <li>Lemann, How the Seventies Changed America</li>\n                        <li>Packer, The Decade Nobody Knows</li>\n                        <li>Rosenfeld, Subversives</li>\n                        <li>Carter, At Quang Nam, a Raid and a Reckoning</li>\n                        <li>Herring, The Road to Tet</li>\n                        <li>Marlantes, Vietnam: The War That Killed Trust</li>\n                        <li>Scott, Now It Can Be Told: How Neil Sheehan Got the Pentagon Papers</li>\n                        <li>Patterson, Grand Expectations</li>\n                        </ul>',tchnclcm497:'<span class="bold">Course Guide Description:</span> Advanced technical communication for computer science.
